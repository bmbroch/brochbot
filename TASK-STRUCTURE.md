## How This Works

1. **Priority Tasks (P0/P1/P2)** = Main assignments you give me
   - P0 = Drop everything else and do this
   - P1 = Important but not on fire
   - P2 = Nice to have when time allows

2. **Business Tasks** = Recurring work for each business
   - Daily = Check every morning during briefing
   - Weekly = Compile and report weekly
   - Projects = Specific initiatives per business

3. **Completed** = Track what's done for reference

## Current Focus
Working on **P0: Competitor monitoring** for Interview Sidekick's main threats (FinalRound, Parakeet, LockedIn).

Next up: **P1: UGC tracker** to automate Nick's payment calculations.
